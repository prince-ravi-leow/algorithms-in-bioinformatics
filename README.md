# Introduction
This repository contains a curated data analysis, conducted as part of the bioinformatics-focused masterâ€™s course, (Algorithms in Bioinformatics](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/2021-2022/22125?menulanguage=en), taken in the summer of 2022, at the Technical University of Denmark (DTU).

This data analysis will explore the prediction performance of different bioinformatics algorithms. For more details on the algorithms and the data they were trained on, please refer to the attached `ProjectReport.pdf`, that was submitted as part of the course.

# Contents
## Code
The entire data analysis was conducted in the `R` programming language, and is contained within the `.Rmd` (RMarkdown file). However for a more interactive experience, I would recommend viewing the exported `.html`. It contains clickable bookmarks for easier navigation, the ability to hide and show corresponding code, and is generally easier on the eyes.
